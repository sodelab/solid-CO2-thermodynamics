    "## 1. Quasi-Harmonic Approximation (QHA) Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is the Quasi-Harmonic Approximation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "While the Harmonic Approximation assumes atoms vibrate around fixed equilibrium positions with constant vibrational frequencies, it fails to capture thermal expansion. The **Quasi-Harmonic Approximation (QHA)** extends this by allowing phonon frequencies to depend explicitly on the crystal volume. This dependency captures thermal expansion and other volume-dependent thermodynamic properties more accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **From Harmonic to Quasi-Harmonic:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how we progress from the harmonic to the quasi-harmonic treatment:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Harmonic Approximation**: Atoms vibrate around fixed equilibrium positions, assuming constant frequencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Volume Dependency**: Realizing that vibrational frequencies depend on crystal volume—changes in lattice spacing affect atomic interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multiple Volumes**: Compute vibrational frequencies at several different volumes, each treated harmonically.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Thermal Equilibrium**: At each temperature and pressure, find the volume that minimizes the free energy, thus predicting thermal expansion.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **QHA Results**: Derive thermodynamic properties such as free energy, entropy, heat capacity, and equilibrium volume from these volume-dependent phonon calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Hessian Matrix in the QHA Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "In QHA calculations, the **Hessian matrix** remains central, defined as the second derivative of the energy with respect to atomic displacements:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H_{i\\alpha,j\\beta}(V) = \\frac{\\partial^2 E(V)}{\\partial u_{i\\alpha}\\partial u_{j\\beta}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \\$V\\$ explicitly indicates volume dependency\n",
    "* Indices \\$i,j\\$ label atoms, while \\$\\alpha, \\beta\\$ represent Cartesian directions\n",
    "* \\$u\\_{i\\alpha}\\$ is displacement of atom \\$i\\$ in the direction \\$\\alpha\\$\n",
    "* \\$E(V)\\$ is the volume-dependent potential energy\n",
    "\n",
    "This Hessian is computed at each sampled volume, allowing the determination of volume-dependent phonon frequencies and subsequently thermodynamic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Free Energy Minimization Principle**\n",
    "\n",
    "QHA relies on minimizing the Helmholtz free energy \\$F(V,T)\\$ at fixed temperature \\$T\\$ to find equilibrium volume:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(V,T) = E_{static}(V) + F_{vib}(V,T)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",
    "F_{vib}(V,T) = k_B T \\sum_{\\vec{q},j} \\ln\\left[2\\sinh\\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega_j(\\vec{q}, V)}{2k_B T}\\right)\\right]\n",

    "### **Vibrational Contribution to Internal Energy**\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the Quasi-Harmonic Approximation (QHA), once the equilibrium volume $ V(T) $ at a fixed temperature $ T $ has been determined by minimizing the Helmholtz free energy $ F(V,T) $, we explicitly calculate the vibrational contribution to the internal energy, $ U_{\\text{vib}}(V,T) $:\n",

    "Phonon calculations within the QHA framework often require sampling multiple points in the **Brillouin zone (BZ)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Zone-center (Γ-point) phonons alone are insufficient for accurate thermodynamics.\n",

    "QHA provides insights into several critical thermodynamic properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thermal Expansion**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Variation of equilibrium volume with temperature\n",
    "   * Captured explicitly due to volume-dependent phonon frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Heat Capacity (\\$C\\_V\\$)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Directly calculated from vibrational density of states (DOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bulk Modulus (\\$B\\$)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Describes material compressibility\n",
    "   * Obtained from curvature of the free energy vs. volume curve\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Entropy (\\$S\\$) and Free Energy (\\$F\\$)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Fundamental quantities derived from phonon DOS and frequency distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Phonon Dispersion and Density of States (DOS)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to standard phonon theory, two critical components of QHA are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Phonon Dispersion**: Illustrates phonon frequencies across wavevectors in the Brillouin zone at various volumes.\n",
    "* **Phonon DOS**: Statistical representation of phonon states at given frequencies, essential for calculating thermodynamic properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementing the QHA Workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "The QHA computational workflow involves several clear steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Volume Sampling**: Generate multiple crystal structures with systematically varied volumes.\n",
    "2. **Static Energy Calculations**: Determine \\$E\\_{static}(V)\\$ for each volume.\n",
    "3. **Hessian and Phonon Calculation**: Compute Hessians and phonon frequencies at each volume.\n",
    "4. **Free Energy Evaluation**: Calculate vibrational contributions to the free energy at various temperatures.\n",

    "## 9. Summary and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What You've Accomplished:**\n",
    "1.  **Ran a full QHA workflow**: From a single optimized structure, you calculated its thermodynamic properties over a range of temperatures and pressures.\n",
    "2.  **Automated a complex calculation**: You converted a manual, step-by-step process into a reusable function to efficiently study different conditions.\n",
    "3.  **Analyzed thermodynamic behavior**: You generated plots to visualize how both temperature and pressure affect key material properties like volume and bulk modulus.\n",
    "4.  **Practiced robust data management**: You used a storage system that saves intermediate and final results with unique names, ensuring reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "- **Repeat for other phases**: Copy this notebook and adapt it for other CO₂ crystal structures (like Cmce, P42mnm) that you optimized in the previous project. The `QHAStorage` class is designed to keep the results for each phase neatly separated.\n",
    "- **Build a P-T Phase Diagram**: Once you have QHA results for multiple phases, you can plot their Gibbs free energy (G) vs. temperature at a given pressure. The phase with the lowest G is the most stable. The points where the G curves cross define the phase boundaries.\n",
    "- **Explore different parameters**: Try running the QHA with a denser k-point mesh (`nk=12`) or more volume steps to see how it affects the accuracy of the results."
